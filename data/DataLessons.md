CSS uses color values to specify a color. Typically, these are used to set a color either for the foreground of an element (i.e. its text) or else for the background of the element. They can also be used to affect the color of borders and other decorative effects. \n\n You can specify your color values in various formats. The most comon are: keywords, RGB and Hex-Codes. \n\n <strong>Keywords</strong> \nCSS supports the color names to be directly passed to the property background-color and color. 140 standard color names are supported by CSS. You can use names like 'black', 'green', 'red' and many more. \n\n <strong>RGB</strong> \n - This color value is specified using the rgb( ) property. \n - It takes three values, one each for RED, GREEN and BLUE. \n - The value can be an integer between 0 and 255 or a percentage. \n <strong>NOTE</strong>: All the browsers does not support rgb() property of color so it is recommended not to use it.\n\n <strong>Hexadecimale Codes</strong> \n A hexadecimal is a 6 digit representation of a color. The first two digits(RR) represent a red value, the next two are a green value(GG), and the last are the blue value(BB). \n A hexadecimal value can be taken from any graphics software like Adobe Photoshop, Jasc Paintshop Pro, or even using Advanced Paint Brush. \n Each hexadecimal code will be preceded by a pound or hash sign '#'. Following are the examples of hexadecimal notation. \n <strong>Note</strong>: To specify the hexadecimal codes, you can use upper case or lower case letters.
