CSS Units define the measurement system used to specify the values. CSS offers a number of different units for expressing length and measurement. CSS unit is used to specify the property size for a page element or its content. \n\n There are a number of ways to specify and measure length in CSS. It is used to specify margins, padding, font size, width, height, border, etc. \n\n For example - font-size: 50px, here number 50 has a suffix px i.e., pixel, it is a CSS measurement unit. \n\n Length units can be categorized into two types: \n <strong>Absolute units</strong>: Fixed unit lengths that does not depend on screen width. \n <strong>Relative units</strong>: Responsive unit lengths that changes according to screen width. \n\n <strong>Absolute Length Units</strong> \n These units are categorized as fixed-length units, which means that lengths specified with absolute units maintain an exact, unchanged size on the screen. \n\n These units prove to be very effective when the browser has comprehensive information about the properties of the screen, the printer being used, or other appropriate user agents. \n\n <strong>px</strong> = Pixels (screen dots) \n <strong>pt</strong> = Points (1pt = 1/72 inch) \n <strong>cm</strong> = Centimeters \n <strong>mm</strong> = Millimeters \n <strong>in</strong> = Inches \n\n <strong>Relative units</strong> \n Relative length units are measured in relation to other elements or viewport of the screen. \n Relative units are great for styling responsive websites because they can be adjusted proportionally based on window size or parent elements. These units define lengths relative to other length properties. \n\n <strong>em</strong> = Font-size of the element itself \n <strong>rem</strong> = Font-size of the root element \n <strong>vw</strong> = 1% of viewport width \n <strong>vh</strong> = 1% of viewport height \n\n
